###Welcome!
In this project we work together to bring out a simple but very useful tool to solve aerodynamic problems. And we love aerodynamics so much, that we dare bringing it out for free.
If you have questions about the software, or if you want to share data and/or chat with other users, you can join the community (www.openvogel.com).

If you are willing to give us a hand with the development, you are at the right place.
Open VOGEL is fully based in the .NET Framework, and it has been programmed in VB and C#. 
For the GUI, VOGEL is based in WinForms and SharpGL.
If you are familiar with at least one of these programming languages and API's, and you have a good knowledge of aerodynamics, algebra or finite element methods, you can help us with the development. A strong spirit of cooperation is cernainly also required.

If you are new to this, follow the next steps:

- Download and install Visual Studio 2015 Community in your computer
- Add the GitHub plugin to VS and sign up.
- Fork this project to a local repository.
- Commit to an issue from the list (or submit a new issue).
- Start working on the code.
- When you think the job is done, create a new pull request (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
- Discuss with the group members about possible issues or corrections (code styling, comments, etc.).
- Solve possible issues.
- Waint until a member with push access merges your changes.

####Some rules
Comments in the code should be written in simple English. For practical reasons, we will not accept code written in other languages.
When publishing documentation about a certain module, try to write it in English as well, or try to produce a translated version. There are many people from all over the world interested in this project, so we have to keep a uniform format in order to understand eachother. Writing in other languages outside the code is, however, not forbidden.


Thanks for your cooperation!
