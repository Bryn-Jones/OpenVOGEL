###Welcome!
In this project we work together to bring out a simple but very useful tool to solve aerodynamic problems.
If you have questions about the software, or if you want to share data and/or chat with other users, you can join the community (www.openvogel.com).

If you are willing to give us a hand with the development, you are at the right place.
Open VOGEL is fully based in the .NET Framework, and it has been programmed in VB and C#. 
For the GUI, VOGEL is based in WinForms and SharpGL.
If you are familiar with at least one of these programming languages and API's, and you have a good knowledge of aerodynamics, you can 
help us with the development. If you are new to this, follow the next steps:

- Install Visual Studio 2015 Community in your computer
- Add the GitHub plugin to VS and sign up.
- Fork this project to a local repository.
- Commit to an issue from the list (or submit a new issue).
- Start coding (solve the issue).
- Submit a pull request.
